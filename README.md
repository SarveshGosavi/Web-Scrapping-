Sharing an n8n automation workflow that efficiently scrapes web data without paid APIs. This system respects site boundaries while collecting structured data, saving time and money compared to expensive API subscriptions or complex scraping solutions.
My n8n workflow combines:
→ OpenAI integration for smart data processing
→ Real-time Airtable organization for searchable data
→ Robots.txt & sitemap.xml checks for ethical compliance
→ Multi-endpoint HTTP requests with conditional logic for complex sitemaps
